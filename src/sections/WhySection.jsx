        <p className="mb-6">
          Engineering principles are not just a set of rules to be followed blindly. They are
          the foundational guidelines that emerge from decades of collective experience and wisdom
          in building successful systems and products.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Unlike enforced rules, principles serve as a compass that guides decision-making while
          allowing for flexibility and adaptation to specific contexts. They empower engineers
          to make informed choices rather than following prescriptive instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          These principles foster innovation while maintaining consistency, enabling teams to
          build reliable, maintainable, and scalable solutions that stand the test of time.
